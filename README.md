Course of study on how to become a Complete Geek.

## Introduction

What is a Complete Geek? It's someone who can get a high-paying job in the tech industry, manage their money wisely, invest for the future, retire when they want to, and live a good life.

This document describes a few paths. There are many more. And you don't have to complete a path to be successful and happy.

This is for people who want to guide their own journey. For the Technical Skills portion, another approach is that of [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)

### Requirements (Who is this for?)

* You need a basic knowledge of computers. You should be able to browse to specific websites, use Google, use email, etc.
* You should be competent in written and spoken English.
* You must be willing to work your ass off, though you can do it at your own pace.
* You must be persistent and tolerate frustration. Like most fields, being smart as hell helps, but it's not required. What's required is that you keep trying even when you keep failing. Because trying stuff that doesn't work until you finally find a way that does work describes a big chunk of the day-to-day of a working geek.

## Technical Skills

### Operating Systems (Start with Linux/UNIX; do more later.)

* Linux/UNIX: [Think UNIX](https://www.amazon.com/Think-UNIX-Jon-Lasser/dp/078972376X/)
  * Skip Part III entirely. The great part about learning Linux/UNIX is that the skills persist. Grep or AWK skills will still be valuable in 20 years. This is an old book but Part 1 and Part II are still gold! (We're skipping the part on X Window because I'm assuming we're using Linux/UNIX primarily in a server context.)
  
* Windows: I don't have a good recommendation for this.

* Mac OS: I don't have a good recommendation for this.
  * I will find a recommendation for this. [Max]

### Programming Languages (Pick one; do more later.)

* Python: [Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0134692888)


### Version Control
* Git. Realistically, just learn git and GitHub at this point.

### Configuration Management (Pick one; do more later.)

* Ansible

### Cloud Environment (Pick one; do more later.)

* AWS
* OpenStack
* Google Cloud
* Microsoft Azure
