Course of study on how to become a Complete Geek.

## Introduction

What is a Complete Geek? It's someone who can get a high-paying job in the tech industry, manage their money wisely, invest for the future, retire when they want to, and live a good life.

This document describes a few paths. There are many more. And you don't have to complete a path to be successful and happy. (No person involved in creating this has completed every path here to its conclusion.)

This is for people who want to guide their own journey. For the Technical Skills portion, another valid and much more structured approach is that of [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). Though we have no personal experience with them, we like that their structure aligns the students' interests with the school's.

### Requirements (Who is this for?)

* You need a basic knowledge of computers. You should be able to browse to specific websites, use Google, use email, etc.
* You need a computer and reasonable Internet access.
* You should be competent in written and spoken English.
* You must be willing to work your ass off, though you can do it at your own pace.
* You must be persistent and tolerate frustration. Like most fields, being smart as hell helps, but it's not required. What's required is that you keep trying even when you keep failing. Because trying stuff that doesn't work until you finally find a way that does work describes a big chunk of the day-to-day of a working geek.

## Complete Geek Career Fields


## Technical Skills

### Technical Pathways

You'll need to know the stuff in General Office / Basic Skills and one Desktop Operating System of your choice.

Then you'll study Linux/UNIX.

Then one of the scripting languages.

Study further programming languages as your interests lead you.

Continue with the rest of the program in order.


### General Office / Basic Skills (You gotta have all of these.)
* Basic competence in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel
    * Power-user level (especially in Excel) at a later date.
* Text editing (using the editor of your choice) in Markdown
* Typing (touch typing, two-finger typing, nose typing, or whatever) with competence and a reasonable rate of speed. 

### Desktop Operating Systems
* If you don't have a preference and can afford it, get an Apple laptop or desktop. If you have a preference, get that.
* Any of Windows or Mac OS or Linux or FreeBSD or whatever is fine as long as you're comfortable in it. But whichever you pick, get to a power-user level of competence. 
* Windows resources: I don't have a good recommendation for this.
* Mac OS resources: I don't have a good recommendation for this.
  * I will find a recommendation for this. [Max]

### Server Operating Systems (Start with Linux/UNIX; do more later.)

* Linux/UNIX: [Think UNIX](https://www.amazon.com/Think-UNIX-Jon-Lasser/dp/078972376X/)
  * Skip Part III entirely. The great part about learning Linux/UNIX is that the skills persist. Grep or AWK skills will still be valuable in 20 years. This is an old book but Part 1 and Part II are still gold! (We're skipping the part on X Window because I'm assuming we're using Linux/UNIX primarily in a server context.)
  * Esoteric Unix Skills: At your leisure, do a deep dive into some of these subjects. Make sure to include regular expressions.
    * [Mastering Regular Expressions](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Regular-Expressions-Jeffrey-Friedl/dp/0596528124)
    * [Sed & Awk](https://www.amazon.com/Sed-Awk-2nd-Edition/dp/B00007FYIJ)
  
* Windows: I don't have a good recommendation for this.


### Programming Languages (Pick one; do more later.)

#### Scripting Languages (If new to programming start here with one of the following.)

* Python: [Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0134692888)
  * [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914) If you've already started studying Python 2 it's OK to finish that before moving to Python 3.

* Ruby: [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Ruby-Hard-Way-Computational/dp/032188499X)

#### Algorithms and the basics of computer sciency stuff like big-o notation

#### Programming Practices, Rules of Thumb, and Horror Stories


#### iPhone and Mac OS Programming


#### Android Development

#### C

#### C++

#### Assembly

#### Web Development


### Version Control
* Brief history of version control from vcs to svn to git and how we created decentralized version control with git and then re-centralized it with GitHub.
* Git.
* Github.
* Writing good commit messages and good pull request messages

### Security and Encryption
* Basics of security on the desktop
* Basics of security on the phone
* Auth including 2-factor auth
* ssh, including setting up ssh keys and ssh key auth
* ssh server configuration
* Basics of setting up a secure Linux server
* Basics of setting up a secure Windows server (if studying Windows)
* FIXME(schof): This can go a lot deeper, both on technical issues and on security as a career.

### Open Source Concepts

### Technical Writing
* Writing Documentation
    * Documentation is not something you do AFTER you finish the job. Documentation is PART of finishing the job.
* Writing good comments

### Configuration Management (Pick one; study more later.)

* Ansible
* Puppet

### Networking
* You must have an understanding of basic networking, including (incomplete and in no particular order): DHCP, DNS, NAT, network troubleshooting tools and methodology, routing, etc. You should understand what's actually going on in your home router / access point.
* There is almost no limit to how deeply you can study networking. Whether or not you make networking your career, getting better at networking will make you better at almost every technical field.
* You can self-study or there are are clearly-defined and widely-recognized study paths and certifications (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE, etc.)

### Cloud Environment (Pick one; study more later.)

* AWS
* OpenStack
* Google Cloud
* Microsoft Azure

## Business and Management Skills
