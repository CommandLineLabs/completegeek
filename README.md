# Introduction

## What is a Complete Geek?

What is a Complete Geek? It's someone who can get a high-paying job in the tech industry, manage their money wisely, invest for the future, retire when they want to, and live a good life.

In the American Heritage dictionary, ["complete" has some of the following definitions](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=complete&submit.x=42&submit.y=23):

* **Having all necessary or normal parts, components, or steps; entire**: a complete medical history; a complete set of dishes.
* **Absolute; thorough**: complete control; a complete mystery.
* **Accomplished; consummate**: a complete musician.

## What's the journey like?

This is for people who want to guide their own journey. The Command Line Labs team will provide as much support as we can, but this is ultimately a self-directed journey for self-motivated people. It is not for everyone.

This is not a Boot Camp. This is not the quickest way from A to B. Bootcamps teach you the basics of what to do and how stuff works, without teaching you WHY it works or what's under the surface.

This is a time-consuming course that will teach you everything you need to know to be a strong, productive computer professional from almost nothing to expert level. It is not fast. It is entirely self paced, though. You can do this as quickly or slowly as you want. Doing this about 3-5 hours a week, it has taken previous students 18-24 months to complete the journey.

I will have milestones or checkpoints at the end of every chapter. Do not proceed to the next chapter until you have completed the checkpoint. The checkpoints are there for a reason. Every chapter builds on the preceding chapters -- do not skip around.

Because this is entirely self-paced, you will have to provide your own drive to succeed. No one will nag you if you don't finish a chapter. This is entirely up to you. That said, we have a community of people who want to help you and want you to succeed! I strongly encourage you to take advantage of the discussion group, where other students or myself can help you. I also encourage you to take advantage of my office hours, where we can do a live call and discuss anything that's confusing you.

## Philosophy

A Complete Geek is a professional. A crafts-person. A skilled worker. We do good work, we take pride in our work, we deal respectfully and ethically with our coworkers, and perform our jobs with high ethical standards and competence.

## Pre-Requisites (What do you need to know?)

* You need a basic knowledge of computers. You should be able to browse to specific websites, search the web, use email, etc.
* You should be competent in written and spoken English.
* You must be willing to work your ass off, though you can do it at your own pace.
* Typing (touch typing, two-finger typing, nose typing, or whatever) with competence and a reasonable rate of speed.
* Basic competence with either Mac OS or Windows.
* You must be persistent and tolerate frustration. Like most fields, being smart as hell helps, but it's not required. What **is** required is that you keep trying even when you keep failing. Trying stuff that doesn't work until you finally find a way that does work describes a big chunk of the day-to-day life of a working geek. If you can't handle the frustration of learning, you probably can't handle the frustration of doing the job.

## Requirements (What do you need to have?)

At this time, there's a non-zero amount of money you'll need to spend to participate in this program, although we're trying hard to keep it to a minimum.

The most expensive thing you'll need is a Mac (Apple) or Windows computer. It doesn't have to be a super-recent or powerful one. (If you already have a Linux laptop, you're maybe not the target for this book.)

You'll also (later) need about $5 a month to pay for a virtual server hosted in the cloud. And of course you'll need relatively decent Internet access. (If you can watch videos, your Internet is good enough.)
