# How To Invest

**FIXME/TODO:**

    * Add info about rebalancing.
    * Add info about balancing between account types (taxable and non-taxable).
    * Add guidance on selecting the percentage of your portfolio in bonds.
    * Add more information about factors and tilting towards certain factors.
        * value vs growth
        * large cap vs small cap
        * add other factors
    * Explain what stocks are and what bonds are
    * Explain why you need international stocks

Asset allocation is the idea that, by combining different classes of
assets, you can greatly reduce volatility (the amount that your portfolio fluctuates up and down). You get increased stability and safety, probably at the
expense of some gains. (You miss out on the big gains AND the big losses.)

For instance, if you invest only in Google stock, you'll have the chance of doing very well if Google does well, and the chance of doing very poorly if Google does poorly. If you invest in a more diversified portfolio, Â you'll have a much higher chance of keeping your money, with a lower chance of making a huge killing. (Remember, the most common way to make a small fortune in the stock market is to start with a big one.)

One of the basic tenets of investing is that you get rewarded for risk. If a particular asset or class of assets has a high return, you can feel assured that it has a high risk. Assets with a lower risk always have a lower return. Anytime you see anyone claiming high return with a low risk, you know you're seeing a fraud in action. ([Bernie Madoff claimed this about his investments.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal))

Asset allocation allows you to mix high return (with high risk)
investments with lower risk (and lower return) investments. This way you
still get some benefit of high-risk investments, with much less chance
of losing a major chunk of your investment.

There's two ways you'll be balancing your assets:

* Among types of assets: stocks, bonds, and subclasses of both
* Among account types -- primarily tax-free retirement accounts and taxable accounts. You'll want some type of assets (which are subject to capital gains taxes) in a tax-free account, and others in taxable accounts.

Today we're going to be talking just about balancing your assets between asset classes, not account types.

## Sample Portfolios

In all of these sample portfolios, the allocation to bonds is set to 30%. That's somewhat arbitrary; feel free to increase that allocation (if you need the feeling of comfort and stability) or decrease it (if you're comfortable with more risk.)

Additionally, the percentage allocated to different stock funds is somewhat arbitrary. I'd keep mostly to these percentages, but feel free to make small changes. There's no way of predicting which allocation will do best in the future, so we're just making our best guess now. It's far more important that you have an allocation you can stick with than that you have a "perfect" allocation.

I'm primarily using Vanguard funds and ETFs, but you can feel free to substitute similar funds and ETFs from other companies. (As long as the expense ratios are similar. Lower is better. Make sure you check this before investing.)

### The Very Simplest

* 30% -- Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund ([VBTLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vbtlx)) -- A little bit of every bond in the US
* 50% -- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ([VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax)) -- A little bit of every stock inside the US
* 20% -- Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund ([VTIAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtiax)) -- A little bit of every stock outside the US

### Let's tilt towards "Growth" stocks

If we add the S&P 500 -- the 500 largest companies in the United States -- then we're tilting towards "growth" -- stocks that everyone thinks are going up. Think Apple, Tesla, etc. The problem with that is that because everyone "knows" those stocks are going up, they're often expensive to buy, so you don't get as good a return in the long term. Or you might. We can't predict the future. Tilting towards "Growth" or "Value" stocks is largely about your own psychology and how you feel.

* 30% -- Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund ([VBTLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vbtlx))
* 20% -- Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ([VOO](https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/voo/vanguard-sp-500-etf)) -- An ETF consisting of the 500 largest US-based stocks
* 30% -- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ([VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax)) -- A little bit of every stock inside the US
* 20% -- Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund ([VTIAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtiax)) -- A little bit of every stock outside the US

### Let's tilt towards "Value" stocks instead

Value stocks are those that are lower-priced relative to the value of the company. They are generally expected to return a higher return than other stocks -- but at a correspondingly higher risk. Also the return of value stocks over time has been pretty lumpy -- substantial periods of under-performing the general stock market, with shorter periods of outperforming the market. I have a tilt towards value in my portfolio, but it's by no means a "gimmie" or an obvious win.

* 30% -- Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund ([VBTLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vbtlx))
* 20% -- Vanguard Value ETF ([VTV](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vtv)) -- An ETF consisting of US-based value stocks
* 30% -- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ([VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax)) -- A little bit of every stock inside the US
* 20% -- Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund ([VTIAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtiax)) -- A little bit of every stock outside the US

### Let's get even more conservative with our bonds

Risk on bonds is dependent on duration -- how much time before the bond is payed off. Loaning money to someone to be paid back in 10 years is riskier than loaning money that will be paid back in 6 months. There's just a lot more that can go wrong in 10 years.

Our previous bond fund (VBTLX) includes all the bonds in the United States -- government and commercial at short, medium, and long durations.

By limiting our bond fund to short-term duration bonds, we lower our risk, but also lower our potential return. This might be a good fit for a portfolio that takes on a little more risk in the stock portion, like our value tilt portfolio.

* 30% --Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF ([BSV](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bsv)) -- Only short-term bonds in the US
* 20% -- Vanguard Value ETF ([VTV](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vtv)) -- An ETF consisting of US-based value stocks
* 30% -- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ([VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax)) -- A little bit of every stock inside the US
* 20% -- Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund ([VTIAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtiax)) -- A little bit of every stock outside the US

### How about adding some real estate?

REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are like ETFs, but for real estate. A REIT may own a sample of the broad real estate market, or may be limited to a particular class of real estate, like office buildings or apartments.

* 15% -- Vanguard Value ETF ([VTV](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vtv)) -- An ETF consisting of US-based value stocks
* 25% -- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ([VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax)) -- A little bit of every stock inside the US
* 15% -- Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund ([VTIAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtiax)) -- A little bit of every stock outside the US
* 10% -- Vanguard Real Estate ETF ([VNQ](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vnq)) -- A little bit of every real estate asset class in the US.
* 5% -- Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF ([VNQI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vnqi)) -- A little bit of every real estate asset class outside the US (international)
