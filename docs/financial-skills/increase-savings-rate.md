# Increase Your Savings Rate

The most important part of retirement planning is increasing your saving rate. Someone who saves 30% of her income but invests with mediocre returns will be far better off than someone who invests 10% of the same income brilliantly.

There's some confusion about this, so let's dig into what does and does not count as saving your money.

These go in the "spending your money" category:

* Buying groceries, paying rent, and all the other expenses of daily living
* Paying off the amount you put on your credit cards **this month**
* Paying interest on any debt
* Paying taxes

These go in the "saving your money" category:

* Paying back the principal on any debt (not counting the current month's credit card spending)
* Putting money in your emergency fund
* Putting money in your tax-advantaged retirement accounts
* Putting money into your regular (non-retirement) investment accounts

Let's emphasize one key point again: Paying off the credit-card debt that you took on this month is NOT saving. It's just paying your bill. Remember, you should not put anything on a credit card unless you can pay it off when the bill is due without paying interest.

Paying off **old** credit-card debt (or any debt) **is** considered saving. If you want to get technical, the interest you pay on old debt is spending, and the principal you pay back is saving. I'm not sure how important it is to track this distinction though.

What I learned there is that the single most important way to secure your financial future is to spend significantly less than you make. This helps you in two ways:

1. Your nest egg grows more
    quickly
2. Once you retire, if you keep your expenses low, you can live on a
    smaller nest egg.
