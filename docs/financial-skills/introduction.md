# Introduction

Being "good with money" is simple, but not necessarily easy, just like running a marathon. Running a marathon is simple -- start running and don't stop for 42.195 kilometers (26.21875 miles). But very few people would say that running a marathon is easy.

We'll cover the basics on this page, and future chapters will add more detail, but this will not be a long volume. The best things you can do for your future financially are all simple and easy to understand.

The advice we give here should be about as controversial as a doctor telling you to eat more vegetables, get frequent exercise, and brush your teeth twice a day. We're keeping it simple, not going for advanced techniques that are usually either less effective than the simple stuff, or appropriate only for people with family-office type money.

You'll hear a lot of advice about getting rich quickly. Getting rich quickly is gambling, which means you might win big, but you're more likely to lose big.

In this guide, we're all about getting rich **slowly**. It's a lot less sexy than getting rich quickly, but it has the advantage of actually working. If you follow the advice in this guide, you **will** get rich. It'll just take a while. (So the earlier you start, the better!)

This guide is written for someone just starting in out in personal finance. It assumes you know almost nothing. We're going to try and explain everything. (Please let us know if there's something we haven't explained adequately!)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** While the basic principles we discuss in this guide are universal, the details on how to implement them are specific to people in the United States. We'd like to add more information for Complete Geeks outside the US, but haven't done that yet.
