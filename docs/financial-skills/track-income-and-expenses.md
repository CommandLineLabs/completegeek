# Track Income and Expenses

You have to spend less than you earn (or earn more than you spend). If you can do that, most of the rest of this financial advice is just icing on the cake; you'll do alright even if you ignore it. And if you can't, none of the rest of this material will matter because you're screwed.

I'm going to say that again for emphasis: If you spend more money each year than you make (even by $1) you are in trouble. No amount of clever financial moves will solve this problem. The only solutions are to make more money or spend less money or both.

To do that, you'll need to know how much you're earning, how much you're spending, and what you're spending it on. If the idea of tracking every one of your expenses sounds daunting, don't worry. You don't have to do it for the rest of your life. Just track it until you know where every penny is going, and then coast on autopilot, periodically tracking every expense for a month, a quarter, or longer, depending on what you need to stay on track.

So far everyone who has followed this advice who has told me the results have been shocked that they're spending way more on some particular category than they realized -- whether that was eating out (me), buying books (me), or spending on a public storage unit (not me). It's likely you'll be shocked by at least one thing as well -- so this is an exercise well worth doing.

Once you've got a month of expenses recorded, take a look at the categories and trends. Ask yourself some questions?

* Does this category seem out of proportion? Should we try to reduce it next month?
* Are there any expenses in this category that we can eliminate entirely? Any we can reduce? Pay particular attention to recurring subscriptions, as those tend to get forgotten.

Use debit cards or credit cards for as many transactions as possible, so they're automatically entered in your budgeting software. Whatever you use, you'll have to remember to manually enter in cash transactions, so I try to keep those to a minimum.

The budgeting software I use is [You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com), which as of early 2024 costs $15 a month or $99 a year. You do get a 34-day trial to see if it works for you. The most important thing is that you pick a method of tracking your spending that works with your unique personality. There's other competing services on the Internet, other apps for both Mac and Windows, and more -- there's a number of spreadsheets you can download and use, or create your own. Hell, one of my students got great utility out of just getting a bunch of different-colored highlighters and going over his monthly bank and credit card statements, using a different color to indicate each category of transaction.

However you do it, I strongly recommend you give it a try.
