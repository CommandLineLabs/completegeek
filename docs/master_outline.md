## Websites and Basic Networking

### Creating a Droplet

If you know what you're doing you can create a virtual machine on any service, or even create a VM on your laptop if it supports that. However, I'll just walk you through creating one on **Digital Ocean**.

... steps and screenshots for creating a droplet

... including the basics of strong passwords and why you should have strong passwords

Opening the terminal and SSHing to your droplet
Now that you know about directories, files, and permissions, let's set up SSH Key login instead of password login.

* Basics of public-key encryption
* FIXME/TODO: This can go a lot deeper, both on technical issues and on security as a career.

## Open Source Concepts

## Advanced Networking

* You must have an understanding of basic networking, including (incomplete and in no particular order): DHCP, DNS, NAT, network troubleshooting tools and methodology, routing, etc. You should understand what's actually going on in your home router / access point.
* There is almost no limit to how deeply you can study networking. Whether or not you make networking your career, getting better at networking will make you better at almost every technical field.
* You can self-study or there are are clearly-defined and widely-recognized study paths and certifications (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE, etc.)
