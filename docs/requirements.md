# Requirements

## Who is this for and what do you need to know?

* You need a basic knowledge of computers. You should be able to browse to specific websites, search the web, use email, etc.
* You should be competent in written and spoken English.
* You must be willing to work your ass off, though you can do it at your own pace.
* Typing (touch typing, two-finger typing, nose typing, or whatever) with competence and a reasonable rate of speed.
* Basic competence with either Mac OS or Windows.
* You must be persistent and tolerate frustration. Like most fields, being smart as hell helps, but it's not required. What **is** required is that you keep trying even when you keep failing. Trying stuff that doesn't work until you finally find a way that does work describes a big chunk of the day-to-day of a working geek. If you can't handle the frustration of learning, you probably can't handle the frustration of doing the job.

## Requirements (What do you need?)

At this time, there's a non-zero amount of money you'll need to spend to participate in this program, although we're trying hard to keep it to a minimum.

The most expensive thing you'll need is a Mac (Apple) or Windows computer. It doesn't have to be a super-recent one. (If you already have a Linux laptop, you're maybe not the target for this book.)

### Future Requirements

* Code Editor: We'll start with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It's very good, and it's free. Use it unless you can articulate a reason to use something else.
* You'll need a credit-card and the ability to pay $5 a month to DigitalOcean.com or Linode.com. This gets you a virtual Linux server that will be essential for testing your work.
* You'll need a 1Password.com account. This is about $35 a year. This will be used to securely store your passwords.
* You'll need a GitHub.com account. (Free.)
* You'll need to install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com). It's a replacement for the built-in Terminal program that comes with the Mac. You can get the job done with the built-in terminal, but iTerm2 is just better. It's free too!
* You'll need to buy a domain. We don't have a recommended vendor at this time -- namecheap.com is easy, while others prefer AWS Route53. They'll all be around $10 a year for a .com domain. (You can get any root domain; doesn't have to be .com.) The reason for this is that you'll need this to build a website. We recommend building a professional portfolio site to use for your email address and to help you get a job. We'll cover all that later. For now, get a professional domain. Could be firstnamelastname.com if available, or something similar. Don't get rocketdude420.com or anything like that, at least for your professional website.
* In addition, there will be a number of books you'll need to purchase throughout this program. When possible we'll use free or cheap resources, but there's no substitute, for instance, for [Jeffrey Friedl's Regex book](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Regular-Expressions-Jeffrey-Friedl/dp/0596528124).
