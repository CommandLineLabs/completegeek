# Style Guide for The Complete Geek

Linux vs Unix: When we refer generically to the family of Unix-based filesystems, we say "Unix." Only if we are specifically talking about Linux do we say "Linux."

Quotes: Standard grammar is to put the period or comma after a quote inside the quotes. We do this in normal text, but if following that rule could result in misunderstanding (thinking the period is part of a quoted command when it's not) then we'll break the rule and put the period on the outside of the quote marks.

Code snippets in text: Code snippets (directory names, file names, Unix commands, etc.) should always be in backticks to mark them as code. They can also be in quotes if appropriate in special cases, but in general should not be quoted.
