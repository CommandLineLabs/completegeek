# Financial Skills - The Basics

## Introduction

Being "good with money" is simple, but not necessarily easy, just like running a marathon. Running a marathon is simple -- start running and don't stop for 42.195 kilometers (26.21875 miles). But very few people would say that running a marathon is easy.

We'll cover the basics on this page, and future chapters will add more detail, but this will not be a long volume. The best things you can do for your future financially are all simple and easy to understand. We'll only discuss complex topics like foreign exchange trading, day trading, derivatives and crypto currencies in enough detail to explain why you should avoid them.

The advice we give here should be about as controversial as a doctor telling you to eat more vegetables, get frequent exercise, and brush your teeth twice a day. We're keeping it simple.

## Basic #1: Spending and Saving

You have to spend less than you earn (or earn more than you spend). If you can do that, most of the rest of this financial advice will just fall into place. And if you can't, none of the rest of this material will matter.

You should seek to put 10 to 20% of your total income towards investments, retirement savings, and your emergency fund.
