# Taking Care of Essential Responsibilities

There are two essential responsibilities you'll have to take care of on your road to financial competence and being a Complete Geek. One will apply to everyone; the other may or may not depending on your situation.

## Emergency Fund

The first essential responsibility is to have an **Emergency Fund** -- a
cash cushion to handle emergencies. These emergencies include house and
car repair, unplanned medical expenses, or job loss. The key
characteristic here is that these areÂ **unplanned** expenses. You should
be saving separately for planned expenses such as home remodeling, car
purchases, or elective medical procedures.

Having this kind of emergency fund will keep you from going into debt
when emergencies happen -- and debt is the enemy of financial security.
(Debt can be a useful tool when used carefully -- more about that in the [Pay Off Bad Debt](./pay-off-bad-debt.md) chapter.)

["A Story of a F*ck Off Fund"](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-story-of-a-fuck-off-fund_b_9065308) by Paulette Perhach is aimed primarily at women, but it still hits me right in the feels and gives a visceral explanation for why you need an emergency fund.

### How Big Should Your Emergency Fund Be?

We're going to measure your emergency fund in months of living expenses. Living expenses include rent/mortgage, food, insurance, and everything else you have to pay, with the exception of income taxes. Since the emergency fund is for (among other reasons) when you lose your job, you won't be paying income taxes.

A starting guideline for your emergency fund is that it should be 6 months of your living expenses.  The final goal for your emergency fund depends on how much money you have in investments, and how long you think it will take you to find a new job. If you are confident you can find a new job in six months, that may be enough of an emergency fund. If it's common at your career level and industry to take two years to find a new position, your emergency fund should probably be two years of expenses. There's an element of psychology too -- how much of a cushion in your emergency fund do you need to feel comfortable and safe? I'd probably not recommend going over two years of expenses.

### Where Should You Keep Your Emergency Fund?

The emergency fund should be kept somewhere it's safe, easily accessible (no penalties for withdrawal, no investments that take time to sell) and earns the most interest it can. Note that interest is the **last** criterion. The Emergency Fund's job is **NOT** to make you money. You'll see lots of discussion on That's what your investments are for. Your Emergency Fund's job is to save you money by:

* Keeping you from taking on credit-card debt to handle emergencies
* Keeping you from having to sell your investments at an in-opportune time (when the market is low)
* Allowing you to invest more aggressively by providing a sense of security and comfort
* Giving you a way to escape bad situations (at least the ones that can be solved with money)

I'm going to sort the choices for where to put your emergency fund from least-risky to most-risky. (But everything I'm going to list is low-risk overall, and I would be comfortable with any of these choices.) This list is applicable to the United States; I'm sure similar options exist in other countries but I have little knowledge of them. In a future version we'll add more information about other countries.

* A savings account at your bank. If you have less than $250,000 in your savings account, it's [insured by the FDIC](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/faq/index.html) and 100% safe. This option probably pays the least interest though.
* A money-market account such as [Fidelity's Money market Fund (SPRXX)](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31617H201#!) (there are many others) is slightly less safe than a savings account, and pays a slightly higher interest rate. It's still almost totally safe, and gives you instant access to your funds just like a savings account.
* You could put your emergency fund in a [CD ladder](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/what-is-a-cd-ladder). CD stands for Certificate of Deposit. It's just like a savings account, except you can't take your money out for a certain amount of time determined at the point you open the CD. (There are one-month CDs, six-month CDs, one-year CDs, etc.) If you had two years worth of expenses in your emergency fund, you could have six months worth in a savings account, six months worth in a CD that matures in six months, six months worth in a CD that matures in 12 months, and six months worth in a CD that matures in 18 months. This would be just as safe as a savings account, but not quite as accessible. The idea is that in an emergency, you'd live for six months on the money in your savings account, then cash out the six-month CD and live on that until the 12-month CD matured, etc. If you don't use the Emergency Fund, you'd just roll the CDs as they mature into new CDs that maintain the every-six-months maturity rhythm. For this added complexity, you get a slightly higher interest rate.

## Insurance

The next essential responsibility is insurance, and there's several
kinds you'll need.

In all of them, you'll pick as high a deductible as seems reasonable,
because that does wonders to reduce the fee you'll pay for it.

**Medical Insurance**: If you can, get it through your job. If not, do the best you can. Medical Insurance in the United States is a garbage fire.

**Auto Insurance:** You'll need at least the legal minimum liability insurance required by your state. If you're broke, that's probably enough. If you have significant investments, you're a target for lawsuits, and you should have higher levels of liability insurance. Get a level of liability insurance that's commensurate with your net worth.

Liability insurance is for if people sue you, and collision and comprehensive insurance is to cover damage to your car. If your car is paid off and you have a significant emergency fund, you can save money by skipping this. If your car isn't paid off, your lender will require a specific level of collision and comprehensive insurance. If you would not be able to replace your car if it were totalled, you'll need collision and comprehensive as well.

**Home Insurance**: If you own your own home, you should have
homeowner's insurance. Basic homeowner's insurance often doesn't cover wildfire, earthquakes, or floods, so read the fine print and make sure you get coverage appropriate for your home. If you live in California, you should also get earthquake insurance. If you live in Florida, flood insurance sounds like a good idea.

**Renter's Insurance**: If you rent, your landlord probably has insurance on their building, but that insurance **does not cover you or your possessions.** You should absolutely get renter's insurance. It's relatively cheap, provides liability insurance, and helps protect your stuff in the event it's damaged by fire, flood, or something similar.

**Life Insurance**: If you have dependents, and you don't have enough
investments to support them, you need life insurance so they're taken care of if anything happens to you. Just get simple term life insurance. Agents will try to sell you insurance that doubles as an investment, but just say no -- it's not worth it. Life insurance's job is to help your family if you die, not to make you money.

**Disability Insurance**: This covers you if you're unable to work because of illness or accident. This is more common than you'd think, but very few people have disability insurance. You can probably get this through your job, but if not it's worth looking into on your own.
