### You are the Sucker

> “Listen, here’s the thing.  If you can’t spot the sucker in your first
> half hour at the table, then you are the sucker.”  - *Rounders*, 1998.

When you buy index funds, you are betting that over time, the
stock market overall will rise. (A rising tide lifts all boats.) This
has turned out to be a very good bet. So far, it has always been true.

If you buy an individual stock or bond, you are betting against the
people selling it.

Let's say you're working for living, and you're pretty darn smart, and
you've been studying investment for 5 or 10 hours a week for a few
months or years. Who are you betting against?

Often, you're betting against someone who has the following
characteristics:

- Is very, very
    smart. Finance pays big bucks, and thus attracts the best and
    brightest in our society. (This is actually a serious problem for
    our society, but that's a different post.)
- Is very, very well-trained. This person has an MBA from Harvard or
    Yale or somewhere equally impressive, and has been doing this
    full-time for years after being mentored by the best.
- Works very, very hard. We're talking 60- to 80-hour weeks doing
    nothing else.

In addition, this person has the following resources:

- Has a very skilled, very extensive network of support behind him,
    from skilled programmers making tools, to researchers
    and analysts who have huge libraries of data -- historical and
    current data that is often difficult or extremely expensive for a
    private individual to obtain.
- Has more money than a lot of countries at his disposal.

In addition to the above advantages, which I think everyone would agree
on, there's another advantage that's often unspoken:

- These people have the ability to cheat. They have access to insider
    information, or the ability to move markets (raise or lower prices)
    by their words or actions, or by early access to deals or by a
    thousand other means that have never occurred to me or to most
    people who don't play in those leagues. The person selling you the
    stock may WORK at the company in question, and thus know far more
    about its potential than you do.

These people are elephants. Often, even they can't overcome these
challenges, because when two elephants are jousting, one will lose. You
are a mouse. Can you overcome these challenges? If so, why are you
reading this blog? You have nothing to learn here. (But I'd welcome a
guest post.) But if you're reading this blog, and you're here to learn,
then you've got to realize that you can't reliably overcome all that.
You may do so occasionally, but that's luck, not skill, and it's not
repeatable.

### Unique Risk

Let's look at another reason you shouldn't buy individual bonds -- the
difference between market risk and unique risk.[1. Hat tips to the [Mad
Fientist](http://www.madfientist.com/unique-risk-market-portfolio/) and
[John Bogle](http://www.wealthtrack.com/previous_11-16-2012.php).]
Sometimes the entire stock market will go up or down, and it will carry
most other stocks with it. Even if Apple/Google/Exxon/whatever is doing
spectacularly, the market can go down and take an individual stock with
it. This is market risk, and we can't get away from it.

Unique risk is the risk that an individual stock will go down separately
from the market. I would have bet any amount of money that it's
impossible to go broke by selling sugar and fat to Americans, [but it
turns out I was
wrong](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-11-17/business/chi-hostess-brands-seeks-court-permission-to-liquidate-20121116_1_hostess-brands-gregory-rayburn-madison-zingers).
If you buy an individual stock, you **are** subject to market risk, but
you're also subject to that stock going down because of mismanagement, a
competitor getting an advantage, or just plain old bad luck.

Market risk is enough risk for anyone.

### Diversification

You may plan to diversify using a do-it-yourself portfolio of 15 to 30
stocks. Bad idea. Here I'll just quote from Bernstein's "[The Investor's
Manifesto](/2012/12/30/the-investors-manifesto-by-william-j-bernstein "“The Investor’s Manifesto” by William J. Bernstein"):"

> You may have heard that you can get adequate diversification by owning
> 15 or 30 stocks. In a narrow statistical sense, this is true; a
> portfolio of a relatively small number of stocks is not much more
> volatile than the overall market on a daily basis. This fact misses a
> much larger point: Small portfolios, even with their low volatility,
> are more likely to send you to the poorhouse. Researcher Ron Surz
> constructed 1,000 random portfolios each containing 15 stocks, and
> then followed their performance for 30 years. The “lucky” portfolios
> at the 95th percentile or better returned 2.5 times the end wealth of
> the market, but the “unlucky” ones at the fifth percentile returned
> only 40 percent of the final wealth of the market.

### Conclusion

**Don't buy individual stocks or bonds. Period.**

### Postscript: But I'm Different

But, you may be thinking... what if I can do it? OK. You have the
strength of ten because your heart is pure, and you still, after reading
all the above, want to take on the big guns. OK. Decide how much you're
willing to lose -- it should be the same amount that you'd take to Vegas
to play with. Go ahead and play the market with my blessing. But know
that you're gambling, and what you're doing is entertainment, not
investing -- and if you lose your stake, **do not put more money in.**
If you win, keep playing with your winnings -- but **do not put more
money in.**

## Title: Manage Asset Allocation

Asset allocation is the idea that, by combining different classes of
assets, you can greatly reduce the amount that your portfolio fluctuates
up and down. You get increased stability and safety, probably at the
expense of some gains.

For instance, if you invest only in Google stock, you'll have the chance
of doing very well if Google does well, and the chance of doing very
poorly if Google does poorly. If you invest in a more diversified
portfolio,  you'll have a much higher chance of keeping your money, with
a lower chance of making a huge killing. (Remember, the most common way
to make a small fortune in the stock market is to start with a big one.)

One of the basic tenets of investing is that you get rewarded for risk.
If a particular asset or class of assets has a high return, you can feel
assured that it has a high risk. Assets with a lower risk always have a
lower return. Anytime you see anyone claiming high return with a low
risk, you know you're seeing a fraud in action. ([Bernie Madoff claimed
this about his
investments.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal))

Asset allocation allows you to mix high return (with high risk)
investments with lower risk (and lower return) investments. This way you
still get some benefit of high-risk investments, with much less chance
of losing a major chunk of your investment.

Asset allocation (in other words, how and where to invest your money) is
a huge topic, and I'll be writing about it at great length in the future
as I get closer to [Financial
Competence](/2012/12/29/a-financial-roadmap "A Roadmap to Financial Competence").

There's two axes on which you'll be balancing your assets:

- Among types of assets -- stocks, bonds, and subclasses of both
- Among account types -- primarily tax-free retirement accounts and
    taxable accounts. You'll want some type of assets (which are subject
    to capital gains taxes) in a tax-free account, and others in taxable
    accounts.

Of course, since the Schofield family is still paying off debts, we're
not yet doing any kind of investment -- we've got 2 to 3 years to become
competent at investing before we actually have to do it. Which is good,
because there's a huge body of knowledge about this topic that we're
going to dive into together.

I can't end this article, however, without giving you, my Dear Reader, a
suggestion for your own asset allocation. I'm taking this from [The
Investor's Manifesto by William Bernstein](http://schof.org/?p=1966),
from the "Young Yvonne" example. It's appropriate for anyone just
starting out in investment:

- 25% [Vanguard Total Stock Market Index
    Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&FundIntExt=INT)
- 25% [Vanguard Total International Index
    Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0113&FundIntExt=INT)
- 50% [Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index
    Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0132&FundIntExt=INT)

That mix of funds gives a great mix of lower volatility, lower risk, and
higher returns. We'll be doing something similar to this once we get
[our debt emergency](http://schof.org/?p=1976) handled.

Why you should avoid forex, crypto, derivatives, etc.
