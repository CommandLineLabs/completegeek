# How To Invest

Asset allocation is the idea that, by combining different classes of
assets, you can greatly reduce volatility (the amount that your portfolio fluctuates up and down). You get increased stability and safety, probably at the
expense of some gains. (You miss out on the big gains AND the big losses.)

For instance, if you invest only in Google stock, you'll have the chance of doing very well if Google does well, and the chance of doing very poorly if Google does poorly. If you invest in a more diversified portfolio, Â you'll have a much higher chance of keeping your money, with a lower chance of making a huge killing. (Remember, the most common way to make a small fortune in the stock market is to start with a big one.)

One of the basic tenets of investing is that you get rewarded for risk. If a particular asset or class of assets has a high return, you can feel assured that it has a high risk. Assets with a lower risk always have a lower return. Anytime you see anyone claiming high return with a low risk, you know you're seeing a fraud in action. ([Bernie Madoff claimed this about his investments.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal))

Asset allocation allows you to mix high return (with high risk)
investments with lower risk (and lower return) investments. This way you
still get some benefit of high-risk investments, with much less chance
of losing a major chunk of your investment.

There's two [axes](https://www.grammar-monster.com/plurals/plural_of_axis.htm) on which you'll be balancing your assets:

* Among types of assets: stocks, bonds, and subclasses of both
* Among account types -- primarily tax-free retirement accounts and taxable accounts. You'll want some type of assets (which are subject to capital gains taxes) in a tax-free account, and others in taxable accounts.

Today we're going to be talking just about balancing your assets between asset classes, not account types.

## Sample Portfolios

In all of these sample portfolios, the allocation to bonds is set to 30%. That's somewhat arbitrary; feel free to increase that allocation (if you need the feeling of comfort and stability) or decrease it (if you're comfortable with more risk.)

Additionally, the percentage allocated to different stock funds is somewhat arbitrary. I'd keep mostly to these percentages,

I'm primarily using Vanguard funds and ETFs, but you can feel free to substitute similar funds and ETFs from other companies. (As long as the expense ratios are similar. Lower is better. Make sure you check this before investing.)

### The Very Simplest

* 30% -- Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund (VBTLX) -- A little bit of every bond in the US
* 20% -- Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX) -- A little bit of every stock outside the US
* 50% -- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) -- A little bit of every stock inside the US
