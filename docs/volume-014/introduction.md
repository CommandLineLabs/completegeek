# Introduction

Being "good with money" is simple, but not necessarily easy, just like running a marathon. Running a marathon is simple -- start running and don't stop for 42.195 kilometers (26.21875 miles). But very few people would say that running a marathon is easy.

We'll cover the basics on this page, and future chapters will add more detail, but this will not be a long volume. The best things you can do for your future financially are all simple and easy to understand.

The advice we give here should be about as controversial as a doctor telling you to eat more vegetables, get frequent exercise, and brush your teeth twice a day. We're keeping it simple, not going for advanced techniques that are usually either less effective than the simple stuff, or appropriate only for people with family-office type money.
