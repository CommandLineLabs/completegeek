# Basic Networking

## Introduction

Originally there were local networks, which were called networks because all networks were local. This would connect, for instance, the mainframe in the Physics Dept. with the mainframe in the Mathematics Dept. both on the same campus.

But then they wanted to connect computers that were farther away than that ... they wanted to do something crazy like connect the mainframes at Cal Tech and MIT!

Well, the US Military had a desire for a communications method that could survive a nuclear war, so they paid for ARPANET to be developed. ARPANET, which connected a few goverment installations and major universities, is what eventually became the Internet.

Because the Internet originated on college campuses, there was a broad spirit of trust and responsibility. Nobody would do something illegal or unauthorized on a computer -- they could get kicked out of school!

Then the Internet became world-wide, and popular, and you didn't have to be on a college campus to use it, and suddenly that open posture didn't seem like such a good idea anymore.

This is why network security is kind of a "bolted-on" affair rather than integrated at a deeper level. It wasn't designed to be secure.
