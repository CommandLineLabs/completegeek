### Future Requirements

* Code Editor: We'll start with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It's very good, and it's free. Use it unless you can articulate a reason to use something else.
* You'll need a credit-card and the ability to pay $5 a month to DigitalOcean.com or Linode.com. This gets you a virtual Linux server that will be essential for testing your work.
* You'll need a 1Password.com account. This is about $35 a year. This will be used to securely store your passwords.
* You'll need a GitHub.com account. (Free.)
* You'll need to install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com). It's a replacement for the built-in Terminal program that comes with the Mac. You can get the job done with the built-in terminal, but iTerm2 is just better. It's free too!
* You'll need to buy a domain. We don't have a recommended vendor at this time -- namecheap.com is easy, while others prefer AWS Route53. They'll all be around $10 a year for a .com domain. (You can get any root domain; doesn't have to be .com.) The reason for this is that you'll need this to build a website. We recommend building a professional portfolio site to use for your email address and to help you get a job. We'll cover all that later. For now, get a professional domain. Could be firstnamelastname.com if available, or something similar. Don't get rocketdude420.com or anything like that, at least for your professional website.
* In addition, there will be a number of books you'll need to purchase throughout this program. When possible we'll use free or cheap resources, but there's no substitute, for instance, for [Jeffrey Friedl's Regex book](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Regular-Expressions-Jeffrey-Friedl/dp/0596528124).
