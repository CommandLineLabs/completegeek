# Using Linux

The text we'll be using for this chapter is [Think UNIX](https://www.amazon.com/Think-UNIX-Jon-Lasser/dp/078972376X/) by Jon Lasser. It's a classic, but still relevant for reasons we'll discuss shortly.

The problem with becoming a professional in the Microsoft Windows evironment is that 50% of your knowledge and skills will become obsolete within five years. And it's incredibly difficult to predict in advance which 50% will be obsolete.

With Linux, in contrast, it's quite easy to tell what parts of technology will stick around for a while and what won't. Docker and Kubernetes will probably be obsolete or at least vastly changed by the end of your career. Grep, awk, regular expressions, and sed (a vastly incomplete list) will still be largely unchanged in 30 years, and will still be wildly useful.

So the fact that this book is two decades old isn't a problem. The stuff it talks about is still totally valid.

Skip. X Windows is the technology used to put up pretty pictures on a Linux screen, instead of just text. X Windows is still relevant to those who run Linux desktops or laptops. However, we're focusing on Linux in a server environment here, and X Windows is not relevant for that.
