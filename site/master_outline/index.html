<h2 id="introduction-and-pre-requisites">Introduction and Pre-Requisites</h2>
<p>This document will lead you from not much to complete mastery. Unfortunately, this will cost you some money. I've tried to keep the expense minimal, but it's not zero. Even minimal is a bit of a joke, because you'll need a Mac or Windows laptop, which is definitely not minimal.</p>
<p>You should read through each chapter, and then try the exercises in each chapter. If you can't make the exercises work, re-read the chapter. Do not continue unless you've groked the material in the chapter. Every chapter in this book builds on previous chapters, and you can't skip anything.</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Yep, you'll need a laptop or desktop computer, or regular access to one. This book is written assuming you have a Mac OS X computer. I'll later add support for Windows computers and Chromebooks. There's not much to do getting around that, but I'll try to add some scholarship options later for people who can't afford their own laptop.</p>
<h3 id="software-installed-on-your-computer">Software (Installed on your computer)</h3>
<p>You'll need a web browser (which is free).</p>
<p>You'll need a terminal program, which you'll use to type commands to your computer and to other computers. This comes built-in on an OS X computer, and is a free download on a Windows computer.</p>
<p>You'll need password-management software. I use <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a>, which costs (as of December 2022) $2.99 monthly. An alternative is <a href="https://www.lastpass.com">LastPass</a> which I don't like as much as 1Password, but has the advantage of being free. </p>
<h3 id="online-services">Online Services</h3>
<p>You'll need to pay for a Droplet (a virtual machine) on Digital Ocean or another service. I'll walk you through this later, but it will cost you about $4.00 a month for this.</p>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<p>I'll teach you everything you need to know about Linux, but you'll need to be at least competent at using a Mac or Windows computer. Teaching you that is out of scope for this book, but I hope to provide references for this in the future.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-0-why-linux">Chapter 0 -- Why Linux?</h2>
<p>The knowledge and skills don't go stale.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-creating-a-droplet">Chapter 1 -- Creating a Droplet</h2>
<p>If you know what you're doing you can create a virtual machine on any service, or even create a VM on your laptop if it supports that. However, I'll just walk you through creating one on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>... steps and screenshots for creating a droplet</p>
<p>... including the basics of strong passwords and why you should have strong passwords</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Opening the terminal and SSHing to your droplet</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Let's learn about making directories, changing directories, seeing what directory you're in, and removing directories.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>Let's learn about making files and looking at directory entries.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h2>
<p>Let's learn about absolute versus relative paths</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Let's edit some files with nano</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Let's digress a bit into the history of Linux and Unix as a multi-user operating system.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h2>
<p>Let's learn about permissions and ownership -- how to read them, how to set them. Numeric and Symbolic.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h2>
<p>Now that you know about directories, files, and permissions, let's set up SSH Key login instead of password login.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h2>
<p>Nano is for newbs. Let's learn some vim.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h2>
<p>How to get help. Man pages, TLDP, other resources. Fucking info pages.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xx-everything-is-a-file">Chapter XX -- Everything is a file</h2>
<ul>
<li>Valid Filenames</li>
<li>Wildcards</li>
<li>Devices</li>
<li>Filesystems</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weird-permissions">Weird Permissions</h2>
<ul>
<li>SetUID</li>
<li>SetGID</li>
<li>Sticky</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hard-links-and-soft-links">Hard links and soft links</h2>
<h2 id="unix-grew-it-wasnt-designed">Unix grew, it wasn't designed.</h2>
<p>Individual parts of it were designed, but the whole came together organically. THis is why lots of stuff isn't consistent and doesn't make sense.</p>
<h2 id="processes">Processes</h2>
<ul>
<li>ps</li>
<li>top</li>
<li>proc</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="redirection-and-pipes">Redirection and Pipes</h2>
<p>This is the hidden strength of Linux.
