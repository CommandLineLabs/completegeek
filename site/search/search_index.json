This would connect, for instance, the mainframe in the Physics Dept. with the mainframe in the Mathematics Dept. both on the same campus. But then they wanted to connect computers that were farther away than that ... they wanted to do something crazy like connect the mainframes at Cal Tech and MIT! Well, the US Military had a desire for a communications method that could survive a nuclear war, so they paid for ARPANET to be developed. ARPANET, which connected a few goverment installations and major universities, is what eventually became the Internet. Because the Internet originated on college campuses, there was a broad spirit of trust and responsibility. Nobody would do something illegal or unauthorized on a computer -- they could get kicked out of school! Then the Internet became world-wide, and popular, and you didn't have to be on a college campus to use it, and suddenly that open posture didn't seem like such a good idea anymore.

What is a Complete Geek? It's someone who can get a high-paying job in the tech industry, manage their money wisely, invest for the future, retire when they want to, and live a good life. This document describes a few paths. There are many more. And you don't have to complete a path to be successful and happy. (No person involved in creating this has completed every path here to its conclusion.) This is for people who want to guide their own journey. The Command Line Labs team will provide as much support as we can, but this is ultimately a self-directed journey for self-motivated people. It is not for everyone. Philosophy A Complete Geek is a professional. A crafts-person. A skilled worker. We do good work, we take pride in our work, we deal respectfully and ethically with our coworkers, and perform our jobs with high ethical standards and competence. FIXME: Add open book test notes. Requirements Who is this for? You need a basic knowledge of computers. You should be able to browse to specific websites, use Google, use email, etc. You should be competent in written and spoken English. You must be willing to work your ass off, though you can do it at your own pace. You must be persistent and tolerate frustration. Like most fields, being smart as hell helps, but it's not required. What's required is that you keep trying even when you keep failing. Because trying stuff that doesn't work until you finally find a way that does work describes a big chunk of the day-to-day of a working geek. Pre-requisites Basic competence in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel Markdown basics Typing (touch typing, two-finger typing, nose typing, or whatever) with competence and a reasonable rate of speed. Basic competence with Mac OS. Requirements (What do you need?) At this time, there's a non-zero amount of money you'll need to spend to participate in this program. While we'd like to get that down to zero, at a bare minimum you're going to need a laptop and some software. A Mac laptop or desktop -- doesn't have to be a super-recent one. We'll work to include instructions for Windows computers in the future, but we're not there yet. (If you already have a Linux laptop, you're maybe not the target for this book.) Code Editor: We'll start with Visual Studio Code . It's very good, and it's free. Use it unless you can articulate a reason to use something else. You'll need a credit-card and the ability to pay $5 a month to DigitalOcean.com or Linode.com. This gets you a virtual Linux server that will be essential for testing your work. You'll need a 1Password.com account. This is about $35 a year. This will be used to securely store your passwords. You'll need a GitHub.com account. (Free.) You'll need to install iTerm2 . It's a replacement for the built-in Terminal program that comes with the Mac. You can get the job done with the built-in terminal, but iTerm2 is just better. It's free too! You'll need to buy a domain. We don't have a recommended vendor at this time -- namecheap.com is easy, while others prefer AWS Route53. They'll all be around $10 a year for a .com domain. (You can get any root domain; doesn't have to be .com.) The reason for this is that you'll need this to build a website. We recommend building a professional portfolio site to use for your email address and to help you get a job. We'll cover all that later. For now, get a professional domain. Could be firstnamelastname.com if available, or something similar. Don't get rocketdude420.com or anything like that, at least for your professional website. In addition, there will be a number of books you'll need to purchase throughout this program. When possible we'll use free or cheap resources, but there's no substitute, for instance, for Jeffrey Friedl's Regex book .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#what-is-a-complete-geek","text":"What is a Complete Geek?

Unfortunately, this will cost you some money. I've tried to keep the expense minimal, but it's not zero. Even minimal is a bit of a joke, because you'll need a Mac or Windows laptop, which is definitely not minimal. You should read through each chapter, and then try the exercises in each chapter. If you can't make the exercises work, re-read the chapter. Do not continue unless you've groked the material in the chapter. Every chapter in this book builds on previous chapters, and you can't skip anything. Hardware Yep, you'll need a laptop or desktop computer, or regular access to one. This book is written assuming you have a Mac OS X computer. I'll later add support for Windows computers and Chromebooks. There's not much to do getting around that, but I'll try to add some scholarship options later for people who can't afford their own laptop. Software (Installed on your computer) You'll need a web browser (which is free). You'll need a terminal program, which you'll use to type commands to your computer and to other computers. This comes built-in on an OS X computer, and is a free download on a Windows computer. You'll need password-management software. I use 1Password , which costs (as of December 2022) $2.99 monthly. An alternative is LastPass which I don't like as much as 1Password, but has the advantage of being free. Online Services You'll need to pay for a Droplet (a virtual machine) on Digital Ocean or another service. I'll walk you through this later, but it will cost you about $4.00 a month for this. Skills I'll teach you everything you need to know about Linux, but you'll need to be at least competent at using a Mac or Windows computer. Teaching you that is out of scope for this book, but I hope to provide references for this in the future. Chapter 0 -- Why Linux? The knowledge and skills don't go stale. Chapter 1 -- Creating a Droplet If you know what you're doing you can create a virtual machine on any service, or even create a VM on your laptop if it supports that. However, I'll just walk you through creating one on Digital Ocean. ... steps and screenshots for creating a droplet ... including the basics of strong passwords and why you should have strong passwords Chapter 2 Opening the terminal and SSHing to your droplet Chapter 3 Let's learn about making directories, changing directories, seeing what directory you're in, and removing directories. Chapter 4 Let's learn about making files and looking at directory entries. Chapter 5 Let's learn about absolute versus relative paths Chapter 6 Let's edit some files with nano Chapter 7 Let's digress a bit into the history of Linux and Unix as a multi-user operating system. Chapter 8 Let's learn about permissions and ownership -- how to read them, how to set them. Numeric and Symbolic. Chapter 9 Now that you know about directories, files, and permissions, let's set up SSH Key login instead of password login. Chapter 10 Nano is for newbs. Let's learn some vim. Chapter 11 How to get help. Man pages, TLDP, other resources. Fucking info pages. Chapter XX -- Everything is a file Valid Filenames Wildcards Devices Filesystems Weird Permissions SetUID SetGID Sticky Hard links and soft links Unix grew, it wasn't designed.
